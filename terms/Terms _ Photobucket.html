<p>IF A FREE ACCOUNT MEMBER EXCEEDS 2 GB THEY MAY: UPGRADE TO A PAID ACCOUNT BY SELECTING THE APPROPRIATE PAID ACCOUNT SUBSCRIPTION LEVEL, REDUCE THE NUMBER OF IMAGES IN THEIR LIBRARY TO GET BELOW 2GB OR CLOSE THEIR FREE ACCOUNT. ALTERNATIVELY, PHOTOBUCKET MAY TERMINATE THE MEMBER'S ACCOUNT AND PERMANENTLY DELETE THEIR CONTENT.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Paid Account</strong>: The Paid Account offers several paid options that give the Member more storage, bandwidth, 3<sup>rd</sup> party image hosting, image linking and/or other services. Please note that Paid Account subscriptions are billed either monthly or annually at the commencement of the service.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>IF A PAID ACCOUNT MEMBER EXCEEDS THEIR ALLOTTED STORAGE CAPACITY THEY MAY: UPGRADE TO A HIGHER LEVEL PAID ACCOUNT BY SELECTING THE APPROPRIATE PAID ACCOUNT SUBSCRIPTION LEVEL, REDUCE THE NUMBER OF IMAGES IN THEIR ACCOUNT TO GET UNDER THEIR ALLOTTED STORAGE CAPACITY OR CLOSE THEIR CURRENT PAID ACCOUNT. ALTERNATIVELY, PHOTOBUCKET MAY TERMINATE THE MEMBER'S ACCOUNT AND PERMANENTLY DELETE THEIR CONTENT.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Additional Features of all Paid Accounts</strong>: When you upgrade to any Paid Account, you will also receive:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Premium Support. You have direct access to our tech support team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No Ads: When you're logged into your Paid Account, you won't see any ads on Photobucket pages (note, viewers of your images within Photobucket will see ads unless they, too, have Paid Accounts and you will continue to see Photobucket offers and announcements).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Modifying Your Paid Account</strong>: Photobucket has the right to change the limits at any time. If you are a Paid Account Member, you can always upgrade to a higher-level Paid Account and will have the opportunity to downgrade your subscription level at the beginning of the next monthly or annual period anniversary following any such modifications, depending upon whether you selected a monthly or annual payment option when selecting your Paid Account.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Payments, Expirations, Refunds and Cancelations</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you subscribe to a Paid Account, you authorize Photobucket to charge you using your selected payment method for all applicable fees. If the auto-renewal option is selected, Photobucket will automatically charge your credit card monthly or annually, as applicable, unless you notify us that you want to cancel or disable auto-renewal prior to the next renewal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Paid Account Members are responsible for providing (and updating when necessary) complete and accurate billing and contact information to Photobucket.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Paid Account Members can cancel at any time by contacting <a href="mailto:support@photobucket.com">support@photobucket.com</a>. If you cancel, except as provided below, you will not be charged for any future term of service, and you will continue to receive the service you purchased through the end of the paid term. Fees are non-refundable except as may be required by applicable law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If any fee is not paid in a timely manner, or Photobucket is unable to process your transaction using the credit card information provided, Photobucket may suspend or terminate your account until such time as the applicable payment is made. At our discretion, Photobucket may also delete some or all of your Content so as to reduce your storage space below the applicable Content Limit, which would result in the conversion of your Paid Account to a free account (which is subject to the restrictions described in these Terms).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Paid Account Members are responsible for all taxes. Photobucket will charge taxes when required to do so.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Content and Service Limits</strong></p>
<p>Photobucket continues to grow and get better because of users like you (Thank you!). If you are a Member, you can upload image files of any, number, size or quality ("<strong>Content</strong>"). However, here are some limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>File Size and Bandwidth Limits</strong>: The file size, bandwidth and amount of storage you have are based on your account level (stated above).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Types of Content Limits</strong>: At Photobucket, we strive to create a place where everyone feels welcome, so please be mindful of others. Broadly speaking, please do not upload Content you didn't create, that violates somebody else's rights, demeans another person, is offensive or harassing, seeks personal information or passwords, is a form of spam or that is illegal. We reserve the right to terminate your use for violation of these prohibitions or similar activities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Content &amp; Privacy</strong></p>
<p>You retain all your rights to any Content you submit, upload or display on or while using Photobucket. This means that&nbsp;<strong>you own all the Content you post</strong>&nbsp;and are responsible for its settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can mark any Content you upload as "private." Content marked "private" will not show up in public search results on the Site and only Users you have given access will be able to view the Content.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Although we have created measures to protect your privacy, please be aware that just because something is marked "private," does not mean that only the people you invite will see it. Users may still be able to find the direct URL for a photo or through other search mechanisms, and then share or link to it outside the Site.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Please remember, if you share Content from the Site or provide someone with a direct link to Content, others may be able to see it, even if you marked it "private" on the Site.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you remove your Content from the Site or mark Content as "private" that was previously public, Photobucket will promptly hide it from search results on the Site; however, we might still have it stored in backup files or on servers, and we may retain it as needed. We are not responsible for sites that it was shared to before it was marked "private."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you make your Content public, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-revocable, right and license to copy, sell, convey, distribute, stream, post, publicly display (e.g. post it elsewhere), reproduce and create derivative works from it (meaning things based on it), whether in print or any kind of electronic version that exists now or is later developed, for any purpose, including a commercial purpose with the right to sublicense such rights to others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By making your content public, you are also giving all other Users the right to copy, distribute, publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce and create derivative works from it via the Site, third party websites or applications (for example, via services allowing Members to order prints of Content or t-shirts and similar items containing Content, and via social media websites),&nbsp;<strong>provided such use is not for a commercial purpose</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By uploading, you are confirming that the Content is yours&mdash;no one else's&mdash;and that the uploading and use of your Content does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights, intellectual property rights or human rights of somebody else. If we learn that you are infringing others' rights or are using Content that is not yours, Photobucket has the right to remove this Content and you agree that you are responsible for any costs associated with the infringement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Photobucket may manipulate your Content to offer the Photobucket Services (including transcoding and/or reformatting Content) to allow its use throughout the Photobucket Services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Photobucket has the right to place advertising, promotions, notifications or identifiers, banners and watermarks on or near your Content, and how and what are up to us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Photobucket may moderate Content. However, we are not responsible for what you have uploaded and we are under no obligation to modify or remove any inappropriate Content. We have provided some tools on the Site, such as links to "flag as inappropriate," so you can let us know if you find Content offensive. As a general rule, we allow "not safe for work" ("NSFW") content that is not illegal, violent, hateful or otherwise deemed to be overtly offensive by us in our sole discretion.  We reserve the right to change the designation of your Content and/or albums as from "public" to "private".  We will not, however, change your "private" setting on your Content or albums to "public".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you stop using the Photobucket Services, your Content may remain on the Site unless you actively remove your Content, and the rights you granted to us and other Users remain. Notwithstanding, Photobucket may delete your Content in its sole discretion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to continue to improve the Site and Photobucket Services, we may use software and other things on the Site that we own or that have been licensed to us ("Photobucket Software"). Photobucket has also created the look, feel and architecture of the Site and has posted certain images and videos ("Photobucket Content"). Together the Photobucket Content and Photobucket Software are the "Photobucket Materials." Photobucket Materials are ours and remain ours. Except in viewing the Site, you agree that you will not copy, distribute, publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce or create derivative works from the Photobucket Software. If you follow these Terms, you are entitled to use and display the Photobucket Content the same way you would use other Public Content on the Site.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Limits on Use</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is a violation of these Terms to disrupt the Site or the way it functions, interfere with other Users' enjoyment of the Site or Photobucket Services or use the Site to deceive, harass or solicit people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is also a violation to scrape the Site, fusker files or otherwise make any use of data mining, robots or similar data gathering and extraction tools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may not sell or share your account access to anyone. For example, selling website templates to third parties with images linked from Photobucket.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is up to Photobucket whether to suspend, restrict or terminate your use for violation of these prohibitions or similar activities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other Important Guidelines</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You are solely responsible for your interactions with other Users. Nonetheless, we reserve the right, but are not obligated, to intervene for the benefit of the Site and Photobucket Services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These Terms, the Copyright and IP Policy and the Privacy Policy can change. Again, please carefully read this document and our other policies.

</li>
<li>

NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING MEDIATION AND ARBITRATION PROVISIONS, PHOTOBUCKET NEVER SHALL BE PRECLUDED OR DELAYED FROM SEEKING AND OBTAINING TEMPORARY, PRELIMINARY AND PERMANENT INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AGAINST INFRINGEMENT OR OTHER VIOLATION OF ITS CLAIMED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, OR OTHER RELIEF THAT IT DEEMS REASONABLY NECESSARY TO DEFEND OR ENFORCE ITS RIGHTS OR THESE TERMS, IN ANY COURT(S) OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a Member of Photobucket, if you become aware of misuse of the Photobucket Services by any person, please email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:abuse@photobucket.com"><u>abuse@photobucket.com</u></a>&nbsp;and include a URL at which the material in question may be located. If such misuse includes suspected infringement of copyright or other intellectual property, please follow the&nbsp;<a href="http://photobucket.com/copyright"><u>Photobucket Copyright and IP Policy</u></a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>You use the Site at your own risk</strong>&nbsp;and the Site and services are provided "<strong>AS IS</strong>."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are not saying that the Site will meet any of your specific needs or that you will get any particular results if you use the Site. We are not responsible for the conduct of other Users' conduct on- or off-line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We encourage you to always keep backups of your Content. Photobucket is not responsible if any of your Content is deleted, or if any modification, suspension or discontinuation of the Site or services causes you to lose any Content&mdash;even if you're a Paid Account Member.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While we make an effort to keep the Site up and running at all times, we are not responsible for any errors, omissions, interruptions, deletions, defects, delays in operation or transmission, communications line failure, theft or destruction or unauthorized access to, or alteration of, any User communication, whether the result of our maintenance of the Site or any problems or technical malfunction of any network, servers, software or equipment, Internet traffic or any other failure of any nature.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>The Site may contain links to other websites, wholly unrelated to Photobucket. For example, when you seek to print an image, you will be redirected to Photobucket's print vendor. If you enter the print site, or otherwise click on links to third party sites, you will be leaving the Site. When you do, you will be governed by the terms of use and privacy policy of that other site. You should review that site's terms and policies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
